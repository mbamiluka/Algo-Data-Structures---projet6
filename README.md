# Algo-Data-Structures---projet6
In partnership with Zach Morlan (git: zmorlan1) Shell sort and Quick sort are used in sorting numbers generated at random into an array.

The goal of this program/project was to create two methods (one for shell and another for quick sort) which sort a list of random generated numbers.
